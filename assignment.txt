Technical Assignment
Assignment: Build Bangalore's Smart City Concierge 
Agent
The Scenario
The Bangalore Municipal Corporation has hired you to build an AI concierge that 
helps both tourists and new residents navigate the city. You have their official city 
guide document, but it's outdated (from 2023. Your agent needs to be smart 
enough to use this base knowledge while fetching current information when 
needed.
The Story
Bangalore is transforming into a smart city. Your AI agent will be deployed at 
airports, train stations, and government offices. It needs to understand who's 
asking - a weekend tourist or someone moving here for work - and respond 
appropriately.
Core Challenge
Build an AI agent using Agno that: Uses the provided Bangalore City Guide PDF as primary knowledge Identifies user persona from conversation Searches the web when current info is needed Adapts its communication style based on who's asking
The Two PersonasAI Agent Developer Intern Technical Assignment1
Tourist Weekend Visitor)
Wants: Top attractions, must-eat places, Instagram spotsTone: Enthusiastic, concise, highlight-focusedExample: "Skip the traffic! Take the Purple Line metro to Cubbon Park ₹40, 20 
mins). Perfect for morning walks. After, try MTR for authentic dosas - tourist 
favourite since 1924!"
New Resident Moving for Work)
Wants: Practical info, neighbourhoods, daily life tipsTone: Detailed, helpful, insider knowledgeExample: "For IT professionals, consider Koramangala or Indiranagar - good 
connectivity to tech parks. Koramangala has younger crowd, more pubs. 
Indiranagar is slightly pricier but quieter. Both have reliable internet ACT/Airtel 
fiber)."
Technical Implementations Expected
1 Knowledge Base Setup
Load the knowledge base onto the agent with the appropriate setup
2 Persona Detection & Adaptation 
Your agent must:Detect persona from conversation cuesAdjust response style accordinglyRemember persona throughout conversation
3 Smart Information Retrieval 
Implement logic to:First check the PDF knowledge baseIdentify when info might be outdated (prices, events, new places)Search web for current informationBlend both sources naturallyAI Agent Developer Intern Technical Assignment2
4 Prompt Engineering 
Create prompts that:Detect user persona in a conversational styleGenerate persona-appropriate responsesKnow when to search vs. use stored knowledgeHandle Bangalore-specific context (traffic, weather, tech culture)Hint - your prompts might be your key to success
Example Interactions
Tourist Conversation:
User: "What should I see in 2 days?"
Agent: Detects tourist persona]
"Here's your perfect Bangalore weekend! 
Day 1 Start with South Indian breakfast at Vidyarthi Bhavan 
(their masala dosa is legendary!. Head to Lalbagh Botanical 
Garden for stunning photos. Evening at Commercial Street for 
shopping and street food.
Day 2 Morning at Bangalore Palace ₹250 entry), then explore 
the trendy Indiranagar cafes. Don't miss the craft beer scene  Toit is a must-visit!"Agent notes: Used PDF for classic spots, searched current entry fees]
New Resident Conversation:
User: "Moving here next month for work at Electronic City"
Agent: Detects new resident persona]Searches for current housing/commute info]AI Agent Developer Intern Technical Assignment3
"Welcome to Bangalore! For Electronic City commute, consider:
Housing: BTM Layout or JP Nagar  45min commute, more affordable2BHK ₹2535K. HSR Layout is pricier but has better cafes/nightlife.
Commute: Company buses are lifesavers. Otherwise, book daily 
Uber/Ola ₹300400 or get a two-wheeler. Metro connectivity 
coming in 2025.
Pro tip: Get a local SIM immediately, sign up for Dunzo/Swiggy 
for groceries, and join apartment WhatsApp groups - that's 
where the real city info flows!"

Tips for Success
You ARE encouraged to use AI tools ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) for this 
assignment. We want to see how effectively you can leverage modern 
development tools. Keep in mind, regardless of the AI tools utilised, you will be 
evaluated on the code quality, so itʼs your responsibility to ensure good quality of 
code. It is also your responsibility to ensure you have an understanding of the 
code submitted as you will be questioned upon the same in the follow-up 
interview call. Spend sufficient time reading and understanding the Agno 
documentation. 
Get Started Right Way
 Test the PDF loading first  Make sure you can successfully load and query 
the Bangalore guide before building anything else Start with obvious persona detection  Keywords like "moving here", 
"weekend trip", "just visiting" before getting fancy Build for one persona first  Get tourist working perfectly, then add resident

FAQs
Q What if I can't complete everything in 72 hours?
A Prioritise:  PDF integration  Persona detection  Basic responses  Search 
integration  Polish. Submit what you have with a note explaining what you would 
do with more time.
Q What if the PDF doesn't load properly in my Knowledge Base?
A Try converting to plain text first, or chunk it into smaller sections. Document any 
issues in your README.
Q How accurate should persona detection be?
A Focus on catching obvious cases first. It's better to have reliable detection for 
clear scenarios than complex logic that fails often.
Q How do I blend PDF and web search content naturally?
A Use phrases like "According to the city guide..." for PDF content and "Current 
information shows..." for web searches. Don't just concatenate responses.
Q Can I use Bangalore-specific slang or Hindi/Kannada phrases?
A Yes! Bonus points for authenticity. Just ensure main content is in English and 
phrases are explained.
Q What if web search returns outdated info too?
A Implement basic date checking if possible. Otherwise, document this limitation. 
Real-world agents face this challenge too.
Q How many test conversations should I include?
A Minimum 3 as specified (tourist, resident, another of your choice). Adding 12 
edge cases shows thoroughness.
Q How do I handle conflicting information between PDF and web?
A Acknowledge it! "The city guide mentions X, but recent updates show Y." This 
shows good judgment.AI Agent Developer Intern Technical Assignment7
