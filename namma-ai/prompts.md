# NammaAI Prompt Engineering Documentation

## 🔍 Persona Detection Strategy

### Rule-Based Detection (Primary)
```python
# Tourist Keywords
["weekend", "visiting", "visit", "2 days", "short trip", "sightseeing", "palace", "museum", "tourist", "attraction", "explore", "holiday", "trip", "next week", "this week", "see", "places to see", "things to do"]

# Resident Keywords  
["moving", "relocating", "relocate", "shift", "shifting", "job", "work", "flat", "apartment", "rent", "stay", "living", "settle", "settling", "resident", "permanent", "long term", "next month", "i am shifting", "i am moving", "i am relocating"]
```

### LLM Fallback Detection
```
Prompt: "Is the user a tourist or a resident based on this message? Reply with only 'tourist', 'resident', or 'unknown'. Message: {user_input}"
```

### Explicit Persona Switching
```python
# Manual override commands
'switch to tourist' → tourist mode
'switch to resident' → resident mode
'tourist mode' → tourist mode
'resident mode' → resident mode
```

## 🎭 Persona-Specific Prompts

```

## 🌐 Web Search Decision Logic

### Triggers for Web Search
```python
WEB_SEARCH_KEYWORDS = [
    "now", "today", "rent", "metro", "price", "live", "restaurant", "cafe", "bar", 
    "eat", "drink", "dish", "cuisine", "food", "place", "timing", "rating", 
    "menu", "best", "recommend"
]
```

### Search Logic Flow
1. **Keywords detected** → Trigger web search
2. **PDF context empty** → Trigger web search (treat as outdated)
3. **Both conditions** → Use both PDF + web data
4. **Neither condition** → Use only PDF data

## 📚 Information Source Blending

### Source Attribution Templates
```
"According to the city guide (PDF): {pdf_context}"
"According to recent web search: {web_context}"
"If neither the city guide nor web search provide an answer, use your general knowledge and say so explicitly."
```

### Response Structure
1. **Direct answer** to user question
2. **Source attribution** for each piece of information
3. **Practical tips** (persona-specific)
4. **Kannada phrase** with translation
5. **Emoji usage** for tourist, professional tone for resident

## 🔄 Session Management

### Persona Persistence Logic
```python
# Only update session_persona if:
# 1. New persona is detected (not "unknown")
# 2. New persona is different from current session_persona
if detected != "unknown" and detected != session_persona:
    session_persona = detected
```

### Explicit Override Priority
```
explicit_persona > detected_persona > session_persona > "unknown"
```
