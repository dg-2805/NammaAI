# You: I'm here for the weekend. Any Insta-worthy cafes?
# Agent: Definitely! Try Third Wave Coffee in Indiranagar — great lattes and aesthetic vibes.
# You: Actually, I'm also thinking of moving here next year.
# Agent: In that case, Indiranagar’s also great for living. Slightly pricey (₹30–45K 1BHK) but safe, upscale, and metro-connected.
