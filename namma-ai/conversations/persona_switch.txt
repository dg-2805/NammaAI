**PERSONA SWITCH SESSION - Demo Conversation**

You: I'm here for the weekend. Any Insta-worthy cafes?

🧠 NammaAI (tourist): Perfect weekend vibes! 📸☕️

According to recent web search: Third Wave Coffee in Indiranagar has that minimalist aesthetic - great for flat lay photos! 

From the city guide: Koshy's is a heritage cafe (since 1940s) with vintage charm, while Toit has industrial-chic interiors.

Try The Hole in the Wall Cafe in Koramangala - quirky graffiti walls and great lighting!

*Namaskara* (Hello) and happy weekend exploring! ✨

You: Actually, I'm also thinking of moving here next year. How's Indiranagar for living?

🧠 NammaAI (resident): Ah, switching to resident mode! 🏡 Indiranagar is premium but practical:

**Living in Indiranagar:**
According to recent updates: 1BHK costs ₹30-45K, 2BHK around ₹45-65K. Pricey but worth it for the location.

**Pros:**
- Metro connectivity (Purple Line)
- Walkable neighborhood with restaurants/cafes
- Good for working professionals
- Safe for women, even late hours

**Cons:**
- High rent compared to other areas
- Traffic on 100 Feet Road can be crazy
- Parking is a nightmare

**Alternative:** Try Koramangala - similar vibe, slightly cheaper

*Dhanyavadagalu* (Thank you) for considering Bangalore as home! 🏙️

You: What about the commute to Electronic City from Indiranagar?

🧠 NammaAI (resident): Ooof, that's the classic Bangalore mistake! 😅

**The Reality:**
According to the city guide: Electronic City is South Bangalore, Indiranagar is East-Central. Distance: 25-30 km.

**Commute Hell:**
- Car: 1.5-2 hours in peak traffic (7-10 AM, 6-9 PM)
- Public transport: 2+ hours (Metro + bus combination)
- Bangalore traffic is no joke on this route

**Better Options for Electronic City:**
- Koramangala/BTM Layout: 30-45 min commute
- Bommanahalli: 15-20 min
- HSR Layout: 20-30 min

My advice: Don't do Indiranagar → Electronic City daily. Your sanity will thank you!
