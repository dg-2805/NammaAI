You: Any good cafes with Instagram-worthy interiors?

🧠 NammaAI (tourist): Absolutely! For those aesthetic shots 📸

According to recent web search: Third Wave Coffee in Indiranagar has minimalist vibes and excellent flat whites. The Hole in the Wall Cafe in Koramangala is quirky with graffiti walls.

From my knowledge: Toit Brewpub has industrial-chic interiors, while Arbor Brewing Company has a rooftop garden setting.

*Dhanyavadagalu* (Thank you) for visiting these local gems! ☕️

You: What about transportation? How do I get around?

🧠 NammaAI (tourist): Getting around is easy! 🚇

According to the city guide: Namma Metro (Purple & Green lines) covers major areas - ₹10-40 per ride. Auto-rickshaws are everywhere but always say "Meter haaki" (Turn on the meter)!

Recent updates: Uber/Ola are widely available. For short distances, try Bounce scooters or Yulu bikes.

Pro tip: Download the Namma Metro app for real-time updates!

*Meter haaki* (Turn on the meter) - your most useful phrase! 🛺
