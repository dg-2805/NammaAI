**Internet (Priority rankings):**
From my knowledge: ACT Fibernet is #1 choice - reliable, good speeds (100-300 Mbps plans). Airtel Xstream is backup option.

**Mobile Connections:**
According to recent updates: Airtel has best coverage, Jio is cost-effective. VI/Vodafone okay but network issues in some areas.

**Getting connections:**
